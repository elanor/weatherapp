# Weather Web Application

This is weather web application using https://openweathermap.org API. It has no full search for cities, offering a choice of 3 cities instead: Lappeenranta, Helsinki and Sevilla. Folder "Components" consists of Root, which leads to a Home page with an opening button in it, which leads to Profile page with options to choose. Profile is connected with two other components: Forecast and Selected-Button.
